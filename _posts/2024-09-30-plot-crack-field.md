# Plotting the displacement & stress field of a sharp crack according to linear elastic fracture mechanics

This blog is purely for educational purposes.
Linear elastic fracture mechanics is of vital importance in engineering applications, especially predicting material failure. 
The readers are redireted to the book of `Fracture : an advanced treatise. Vol. 2, Mathematical fundamentals` by H. Liebowitz _et al._ for the detailed derivation of the elastic fields in anisotropic medium.
