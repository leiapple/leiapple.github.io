# Comprehensive Introduction to Bash Scripting

Bash (short for **Bourne-Again SHell**) is a powerful command-line shell and scripting language commonly used on Unix-like systems such as Linux and macOS. Bash scripts enable you to automate repetitive tasks, manage system operations, and create complex workflows in an efficient way.

## 1. What Is Bash?

Bash is both a command interpreter and a scripting language:
- **Command interpreter (shell)**: It lets you type and execute commands interactively in a terminal.
- **Scripting language**: You can create files (scripts) containing a sequence of commands, which are then run automatically, saving time and reducing errors.

---

## 2. Creating and Running a Bash Script

1. **Create a new file** (e.g., `myscript.sh`) with any text editor (`vi`, `nano`, `gedit`, etc.).
2. **Add the shebang line** at the top of the file to specify the interpreter:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
```
3. Write your script by adding commands you would normally run in the terminal:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, world!"
```
4. Make the script executable by running:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
chmod +x myscript.sh
```
5. Execute the script:
```
./myscript.sh
```
or
```
bash myscript.sh
```
## 3. Variables and Command Substitution

In Bash, you can create and use variables to store information, such as strings, numbers, or the output of commands.

### Creating Variables
```
#!/bin/bash
name="Alice"
number=42

echo "My name is $name and my favorite number is $number."
```

### Command Substitution

Command substitution lets you assign the output of a command to a variable:
```
#!/bin/bash
current_date=$(date)
echo "Today's date is $current_date."
```
Alternatively, older syntax uses backticks:
```
current_date=`date`
```

## 4. User Input and Command-Line Arguments

### Reading User Input with read
```
#!/bin/bash
echo "Please enter your name:"
read user_name
echo "Hello, $user_name!"
```

### Command-Line Arguments
$1, $2, $3, etc. represent the arguments passed to the script:
```
#!/bin/bash
echo "The first argument is $1"
echo "The second argument is $2"
```
To handle many arguments, you can use $@ or $* to represent all arguments.

## 5. Control Structures

Control structures allow you to alter the flow of your Bash scripts.

### If-Else Statement
```
#!/bin/bash
aa=3.14
bb=3.14
c=$(echo "$aa == $bb" | bc)  # compares numerical values

if [[ "$c" -eq 1 ]]; then
  echo "true"
else
  echo "false"
fi
```
String Comparison Example
```
#!/bin/bash
flag_0="DISLOCATION"

if [ "$flag_0" = "DISLOCATION" ]; then
  echo "equal 000"
else
  echo "not equal 000"
fi
```
Common Operators:

* -eq, -ne, -gt, -ge, -lt, -le: numeric comparisons
* -z, -n: check if a string is empty or not
* =, !=: string equality or inequality

### For Loops
```
#!/bin/bash
for ((i=1; i<=200; i=i+5))
do
  echo $i
  echo loop.$i.dump
done
```

Another form (iterating over a list):
```
#!/bin/bash
for fruit in apple banana cherry
do
  echo "I like $fruit"
done
```

### While Loops
```
#!/bin/bash
count=1
while [ $count -le 5 ]
do
  echo "Count is: $count"
  ((count++))
done
```

### Case Statements
```
#!/bin/bash
echo "Enter a number between 1 and 3:"
read number

case $number in
  1)
    echo "You chose one."
    ;;
  2)
    echo "You chose two."
    ;;
  3)
    echo "You chose three."
    ;;
  *)
    echo "Invalid choice!"
    ;;
esac
```

## 6. Functions

Functions allow you to group related commands for easier reuse and better structure:
```
#!/bin/bash

function greet {
  echo "Hello, $1!"
}

greet "Alice"
greet "Bob"
```
* $1, $2, etc., in functions refer to the function’s arguments.
* The return command can return an integer status code, and echo can be used to produce function output.

## 7. Working with Files

### Check if a File Exists and Is Not Empty
```
#!/bin/bash
if [ -s pidfile ]; then
  echo "hi"
else
  echo "empty"
fi
```

### Creating, Appending, and Reading Files
```
#!/bin/bash
# Creating or overwriting a file
echo "Hello" > myfile.txt

# Appending to a file
echo "World" >> myfile.txt

# Reading a file line by line
while IFS= read -r line
do
  echo "Line: $line"
done < myfile.txt
```

## 8. Useful Built-in Commands
* echo: Prints arguments to standard output.
* read: Reads a line of input from standard input.
* cd: Changes the current directory.
* pwd: Prints the current working directory.
* ls, cp, mv, rm: Basic file and directory management commands.
* test or [ ]: Evaluates conditional expressions (used in if statements).
* exit: Exits the script with an optional status code (0 for success).

## 9. Error Handling and Debugging

`set`  Options
* `set -e`: Exit the script when any command fails.
* `set -u`: Treat unset variables as errors.
* `set -o pipefail`: Return exit code of the last command that failed in a pipeline.
Include them near the top of your script:
```
#!/bin/bash
set -euo pipefail
```

### Using trap
```
#!/bin/bash
trap 'echo "An error occurred. Exiting..."' ERR

some_command_that_might_fail
echo "This won't run if the above command fails."
```
### Debug Mode
* *Verbose* mode: `bash -v myscript.sh`
* *Debug* mode: `bash -x myscript.sh` (prints each command with its expanded arguments)

## 10. Practical Examples

1. Monitoring Disk Usage
```
#!/bin/bash
threshold=80

current_usage=$(df -h / | tail -1 | awk '{print $5}' | sed 's/%//')
if [ $current_usage -gt $threshold ]; then
  echo "Warning: Disk usage is above $threshold%!"
else
  echo "Disk usage is under control at $current_usage%."
fi
```

2. Backup Script
```
#!/bin/bash
source_dir="/home/user/documents"
backup_dir="/home/user/backup"
timestamp=$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M)

mkdir -p "$backup_dir"
cp -r "$source_dir" "${backup_dir}/documents_${timestamp}"

echo "Backup of $source_dir completed at ${timestamp}."
```
## 11. Best Practices

1. Use Meaningful Names: Give variables and functions descriptive names (count, backup_files, greet_user).
2. Comment Your Code: Explain why certain commands are used, especially if they’re not obvious.
3. Validate Inputs: Check that arguments and user inputs are valid before using them.
4. Quote Variables: Put variables in quotes ("$var") to prevent globbing and word splitting issues.
5. Prefer $() for Command Substitution: It’s more readable than backticks.
6. Use set -euo pipefail: Helps catch errors early and makes your script more robust.
7. Test Incrementally: Run sections of your script as you build it to catch errors before they spread.
